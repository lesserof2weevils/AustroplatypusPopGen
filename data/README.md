These are the raw and pre-processed data files provided by Diversity Arrays used for analyses. Files include:

```Ai_ind_metrics.csv``` is the metadata associated with indvidual specimens sequenced

```Ai_ind_metrics_phylo.csv``` is the same metadata file as above, however, with reduced samples as used for phylogenetic analyses of SNP data

```Report_DAmb20-5632_1_moreOrders_SNP_2_rename_ordered.csv``` is a derived file of the raw ```Report_DAmb20-5632_SNP_2.csv``` file, wherein the genotype fields have been changed to individual specimen IDs

```Report_DAmb20-5632_SNP_2.csv``` is the raw processed SNP data file provided by Diversity Arrays Technology 

```Report_DAmb20-5632_SNP_mapping_2.csv``` is the one row raw processed SNP data file provided by Diversity Arrays Technology 

```Report_DAmb20-5632_SilicoDArT_1.csv``` is the raw processed silicoDArTs

```metadata*``` are the metadata files provided by Diversity Arrays Technology regarding the sequencing run
